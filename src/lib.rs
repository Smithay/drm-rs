//! A safe interface to the Direct Rendering Manager subsystem found in various
//! operating systems.
//!
//! # Summary
//!
//! The Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) is subsystem found in various operating
//! systems that exposes graphical functionality to userspace processes. It can
//! be used to send data and commands to a GPU driver that implements the
//! interface.
//!
//! Userspace processes can access the DRM by opening a 'device node' (usually
//! found in `/dev/dri/*`) and using various `ioctl` commands on the open file
//! descriptor. Most processes use the libdrm library (part of the mesa project)
//! to execute these commands. This crate takes a more direct approach,
//! bypassing libdrm and executing the commands directly and doing minimal
//! abstraction to keep the interface safe.
//!
//! While the DRM subsystem exposes many powerful GPU interfaces, it is not
//! recommended for rendering or GPGPU operations. There are many standards made
//! for these use cases, and they are far more fitting for those sort of tasks.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! To begin using this crate, the [`Device`] trait must be
//! implemented. See the trait's [example section](trait@Device#example) for
//! details on how to implement it.
//!
